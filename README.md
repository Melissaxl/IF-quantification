# IF-quantification

ORIGINAL CREDIT: Kasia Kedziora https://github.com/fjorka/tracking_pipeline

This short Python pipeline is modified from part of the original pipeline to batch-processing IF images (TIFF files)
Segmentation uses CellPose (can be done either with GPU or without GPU) and quantification uses Scikit-image.
